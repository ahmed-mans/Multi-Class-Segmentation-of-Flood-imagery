# Multi-Class Segmentation of Flood Imagery

## Project Summary

This project is the Segmentation Project of the OpenCV University course [_Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras_](https://opencv.org/university/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-keras/?srsltid=AfmBOor6TFbg3fgao3lfzY5EIBo3GTuRqpwvra6nrZBQpmDMZ8B7ZcGY).<br>
The objective is to develop a training pipeline and train a semantic segmentation model on the FloodNet dataset to classify 10 distinct classes. The dataset comprises drone-captured images depicting the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which led to severe flooding. 

The notebook `FloodNet_segmentation.ipynb` was used to process the images and implement the training pipeline for the semantic segmentation task.

## Dataset Description

The FloodNet dataset contains a total of __2343__ images and corresponding masks.__1843__ images are dedicated for training and __500__ images are left for the test set for evaluation.
The dataset consists of 10 classes : <br>
`Background, Building Flooded, Building Non-Flooded, Road flooded, Road Non-flooded, Water, Tree, Vehicle, Pool, Grass `
