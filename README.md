# Multi-Class Segmentation of Flood Imagery

This project is the Segmentation Project of the OpenCV University course [_Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras_](https://opencv.org/university/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-keras/?srsltid=AfmBOor6TFbg3fgao3lfzY5EIBo3GTuRqpwvra6nrZBQpmDMZ8B7ZcGY).<br>
The goal of the project is to apply semantic segmentation on drone images showing the aftermath of the Hurricane Harvey resulting in floods and detect with great accuracy areas that were damaged.
